React Merge Sort Visualizer
This is a web application built with React that visualizes the Merge Sort algorithm. It allows you to see how the algorithm works step-by-step, gaining a deeper understanding of its sorting process.

Features
Visualized sorting steps: Each step of the merge sort algorithm is visually represented, making it easy to follow how the array gets sorted.
Random array generation: Generate a random array of numbers to visualize the sorting process.
Control sorting speed: Adjust the speed of the sorting animation to observe the process in detail.
Responsive design: Works seamlessly on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing state.
D3.js (optional): For creating the visualizations (can be replaced with other libraries like Chart.js).
CSS: Styling the application.
